Hello, My Name is Rukia Njeri.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I am a Mother of Four and a Grand Mother of two who I currently stay with in this house.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I raised the two of my Grand Kids. We have been through a lot.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Their fathers, one is a drunkard and the other had stroke, their mothers died.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So when I was left with the grand kids I accepted and took them in.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And by God's Grace, I found people to help them.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The one in Grade Six is being assisted and so is the one in grade four, Hanan.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I thank God so much. Because I cried to God and told him I don't want these children to suffer.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When I took them in when their moms died, I had faith that God would open doors for them.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I believe God has done it and we continue to praise Him.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
(Channah's Assistance on my part.) I have a small business selling charcoal and paraffin.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:10,000
When I am out there at work I see a lot of people, I don't have stress or time to think about a lot of things.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
All in all I am grateful I don't have illnesses, I have good health, I am over 64 years old

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and God has kept me whole. I am grateful I am not sick.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
May he give me strength to raise my Grandkids and see that they Grow and have good education.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That is my hope. Thank you
